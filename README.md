# FEWCALc

FEWCalc is the Food-Energy-Water Calculator assembled by Jirapat Phetheet and Professor Mary C. Hill from Department of Geology, the University of Kansas.

The calculation is divided into two parts. The first part is crop calculation using a crop model called Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) which was developed by Jones et al., 2003 from the University of Florida. The other is the FEWCalc conducted using NetLogo agent-based modeling software by Uri Wilensky, 1999.
